Server working of Websocket

A Websocket server is a simple program which has the capability to handle the websocket servers events and actions
WebSocket server works in similar way to the websocket clients
Websocket servers can perform some actions:
It is intialized to web socket address
It can also handle Onopen,Onclose and Onmessage events

Creating a WebSocket Server Instance

1)var server=new WebSocketServer("any websocket url");
Any valid URLs can be used with the specification of the port

2)Small part represents the incoming connection that is clients with IwebSocketConnection interface
When someone connects or disconnects from the service ,empty list can be created or updated
var clients =new List<IWebSocketConnection>();

3)We can call the start method and wait for clients to connect
The start method needs a parameter which indicates the socket that raised the event
server.Start(socket) =>
{
});

Methods used in Websocket are:
Onopen:connection of server and the client
Onclose:raises wenever the client is disconnected
Onmessage:raises when client sends data to the server

Advantages of WebSocket
1)It is bidirectional whereas http is unidirectional,client always initiates the request
Websocket is bidirectional but it doesnot have predefined message pattern such as request/response 
2)FullDuplex:WebSocket allows the client and server to talk independent of eachother
3)TCP connection(Single):

Conclusion:
It is a low level protocol (why?? everything including simple request/response and create ,delete,update methods to be build on top of it 
But,http has everything well defined
This is stateful(server thinks that the client is dumb machine)whereas http is stateless
