Task Asynchronous programming (TAP)

It provides an abstraction over asynchronous code

The goal of the syntax is to:
Enable the code that reads like a sequence of statements,
but executes in a much more complicated order based on external 
resource allocation and when tasks completes

The keywords used here are await and async

Best example for asynchronous is cooking breakfast 
HOW??? -One person can handle all different tasks involved in the preparing
One person(single thread) can make breakfast asynchronously by starting the next before the first task completes
Multiple cooks can be implemented(multiple threads can used) but each cook would be blocked synchronously waiting for each task to be completed

Asynchronous code is more efficient than the synchronous code
