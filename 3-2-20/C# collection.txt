C# collections
It represents group of objects 
Operations performed :
Store object
update object
delete object
retrieve object
sort object
Objects can stored in array or collection

Types of Collections in C#

System.Collections.Generic classes:

These namespace has following classes-

1)List<>:there is two ways to implement the lists 
.By giving the values directly ,storing the elements by using the method 
.By using the collection intializer

2)HashSet<>:used to store,remove or view the elements 
Doesnot store duplicate elements
It is used only store unique elemenets
It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace
There are two ways of implementing the Hashset function
.By implementing using collection intializer
.By storing the values using a particular method 

3)SortedSet<>:it maintains the ascending order and doesnot store duplicate elements

4)Stack<>:Used to push ansd pop the elements
Uses the concept of stack that arranges elements in LIFO(last in first out) order
Can have duplicate values
Uses methods like push , pop and peek

5)Queue<>:Used to enqueue and dequeue the elements 
Uses the concept of queue that arranges elements in FIFO(first in first out)
It can also have duplicate elements 
Methods used are peek,enqueue,dequeue

6)LinkedList<>:It allows to insert and delete elements fastly
allows duplicate elements 
Also allows to add and remove the element at before or last index

7)Dictionary<key,value>:Uses the concept of hash table 
contains only unique keys only
By the help of key can easily search or remove the elements 

8)SortedDisctionary<key,value>:Same as dictionary but only thing that is added to this is ascending order
