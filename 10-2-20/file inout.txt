File is a collection of data stored in a disk with a specific name and 
directory path
When is opened for reading and writing it becomes a stream
Stream is sequence of bytes passing through the communication path
Two types of stream:
Input stream-used for reading data from file 
Output stream-used for writing into the file
Namespace :System.IO

Some commonly used non-abstract classes in System.IO namespace :
1)BinaryReader:reads primitive data from binary stream
2)BinaryWriter:writes primitive data into binary format
3)BufferedStream:temporary storage for a stream of bytes
4)Directory:Helps in manipulating a structure of directory
5)DirectoryInfo:for performing operations on directories
6)DriveInfo:Provides info for the drives
7)StreamReader and StreamWriter:reading the characters from the byte stream
8)StringReader and StringWriter:reading/writing from/into a string buffer

FileStream:This class derives from the abstract class Stream
Synatx-
FileStream<objectname>=new FileStream(<filename>,<filemode enumerator>,
<Fileaccess enumerator>,<fileshare enumerator>);

Various Parameters are:
1.FileMode:defines various methoda for opening files
Few members of the FileMode are:
Append ,Create,CreateNew,Open,OpenOrCreate,Truncate

2.FileAccess:
Few members are Read,ReadWrite and Write

3.FileShare:
Few members are-
Inheritable allows a file handle to pass inheritance to the child processes
None declines sharing of the current file
Read allows opening the file for reading
ReadWrite allows opening the file for reading and writing 
Write allows opening the file for writing

StreamWriter:used to write series of characters into the text files

DirectoryInfo Class
It is derived from FileSystemInfo class
methods are creating,moving and browsing
Cannot be inherited 

Methods:CreationTime
Exists
